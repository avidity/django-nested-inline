# README for Avidity Staff

This README is intended for Avidity's developers. It describes why the repo was
forked and how we intend to use it.

## Why was this forked

This repository contains a crucial [bugfix](https://github.com/s-block/django-nested-inline/commit/25a7bee9f165a486bc879b17ea74ca992713bc36])
that for some reason isn't pushed to version 0.3.7 present in pipy.

## Have we made any changes not present upstream?

No.

## Do we need to keep this updated?

No. This repository hasn't seen changes for 2 years, and it's not certain it is
compatible with Django 2.x.
